# ORM-E-Commerce-Back-End-Adam-Cleland

### Description

We are tasked to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code that has been provided by the Ohio State Full Stack Coding Boot Camp. This application will be utilizing a working express.js API along with using Sequelize in order to interact with the MySQL database.

This application allows the user to make all of the crud command to the database and interact with it by adding, deleting, updating, and viewing all of the information that is saved inside of it.
